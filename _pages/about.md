I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Plasma Astrophysics (CmPA) at KU Leuven. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, space weather, and medical imaging. I currently develop space-weather frameworks focused on solar coronal structure detection and segmentation, as well as solar flare forecasting.
